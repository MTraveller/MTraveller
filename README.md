Hello ðŸ‘‹ my name is Mahmoud Tantouri and I love software!
Since 2009 I have been working with servers, hosting, domains, DNS, websites, marketing etc. and always felt something is missing. To truely shine and progress I had to fill a void that has been there from the begining of my career change into tech. I was like walking with a missing leg, couldn't walk properly nor run. During the years I had played around with some code, be it PHP or Javascript, but never understood the fundamentals.

Fast forward 2021 I joined Code Institute to learn and become a fullstack software developer to satisfy the love I have for programming for the internet. I go beyond the basics or needed skills and knowledge. Code Institute started out with HTML & CSS to later include Javascript, then moving on to Python after which we must put all learned languages into a single fullstack project. Between the projects I would buy and study materials outside Code Institute to further understand and fine-tune my knowledge. I've set out to learn Node.js and C# to further widen my skillset.

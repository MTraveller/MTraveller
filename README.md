Hi ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m Mahmoud and I love software!

<br>

Since 2009 I have been working with servers, hosting, domains, DNS, websites, marketing etc. and always felt something was missing. To truely shine and progress I had to fill a void that had been there from the begining of my career change into tech. I was like walking with a missing leg, couldn't walk properly nor run. During the years I had played around with some code, be it PHP or Javascript, but never understood the fundamentals.

Fast forward 2021 I joined Code Institute to learn and become a fullstack software developer to satisfy the love I have for programming. I go beyond the basics and continues to invest in myself, to broaden my skill set and knowledge.

Code Institute started out with HTML & CSS to later include Javascript, then moving on to Python after which we have to put all learned languages into a single fullstack project. Between the projects I would buy and study materials outside Code Institute to further understand and fine-tune my knowledge.

<br>

I've set out to further widen my skill set and learn:

Data structures and algorithms, design patterns.

C#, .NET, Node.js, GraphQL, Gatsby, React Native and Docker.

Future learnings includes Flutter, Kotlin, Swift, Go, SolidJS.
